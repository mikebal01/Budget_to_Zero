This page will serve as the privacy terms for the app Budget to Zero.
The details sored within the app are not shares or backed up anywhere outside the google eco system.
There are no accounts and data entered into the app are local only.  
It is possible that as part of google app store framework that device detials will be reported out as part of thier app store policies; 
However, I don't care what you budget, I don't even thing the app is good enough yet but it would be great to see some feedback.
